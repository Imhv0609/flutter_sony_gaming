# Controller Asset

This file serves as a placeholder for the controller.png asset.

To add the actual controller image:
1. Replace this file with a transparent PNG image of a DualSense controller
2. Name it `controller.png`
3. Recommended size: 520px width for optimal display

The app will show a fallback gradient placeholder if this image is not found.
